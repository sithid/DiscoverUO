# Code Review Summary

## Project Overview
DiscoverUO is a Blazor-based web application for discovering and sharing Ultima Online servers. The project is dedicated to Ben Barnett and aims to create a community platform for UO players.

## Architecture
Modern .NET solution with a clean three-project structure:
1. `DiscoverUO.Web` - Blazor WebApp frontend
2. `DiscoverUO.Api` - Backend Web API
3. `DiscoverUO.Lib` - Shared library for models and DTOs

## Technical Implementation
1. **Database:** SQLite with tables for users, servers, reviews, blacklists, and favorites
2. **Authentication:** Implemented user registration and login system
3. **Architecture Pattern:** Follows a clean separation of concerns with:
   - DTOs in the Lib project
   - Entity models in the API project
   - AutoMapper for object mapping
   - Generic response contracts for API consistency

## Core Features
* Public server listing
* User registration and authentication
* Server management (CRUD operations)
* Favorites system
* User profiles
* Role-based access control (Anonymous, Registered, Elevated users)

## Planned Features
* Voting system for servers
* Enhanced moderation tools
* User and server blacklisting
* Visual design improvements

## Areas for Potential Enhancement
1. **Security:** Consider implementing additional security measures for the authentication system
2. **API Documentation:** Could benefit from OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
3. **Testing:** Adding unit tests and integration tests would improve reliability
4. **UI/UX:** As mentioned in the README, the visual design could be enhanced
5. **Caching:** Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data
6. **Validation:** While there's regex validation for user input, could expand validation coverage
